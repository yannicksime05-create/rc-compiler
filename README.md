# RC Compiler

I love programming languages and I wanted to know how they work under the hood so I decided to create my own one (or at least sketch one).
I know it's gonna be tough, or even really tough, but I still want to give it a try. And by the end, I think this will also improve my coding skills so there's nothing I should be afraid of!

In the project's hierarchy, you'll see:
- **features**: an alphabetically sorted list of all the features I want in this compiler;
- **overview**: a documentation-like folder for the compiler;
- **include**: header files for the lexer, parser...;
- **src**: implementation files.

If 
- you're interested by the features and want to suggest new ones,
- want to improve my code,
- or want to make any other kind of suggestions,
feel free to pull a request, I'll be glad to hear you!
