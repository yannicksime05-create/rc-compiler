@type: keyword

  I remember one day, working on school project written in Java. I don't remember why exactly but I needed to convert an integer to a string.
  In statically typed languages, we'll have to create a new string object and then add the number to it:
  code:
    int i = 10;
    String s = "" + i;
    
  whereas in dynamically typed ones:
  code:
    i = 10;
    i = "" + i

  Since I want this language to be a statically typed one and still want to be abe to do such conversions sometimes (without having about to manually create a new object),
  I decided to create this keyword, so that I'll be able to do:
  code:
    any i = 10;      //and then later...
    i = "" + i;

    and the compiler automatically changes i's type.

I know it's kinda lame to create such thing (with all its possible consequences ðŸ˜…) but I think it's gonna be really helpful.
